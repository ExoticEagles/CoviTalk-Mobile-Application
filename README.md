# CoviTalk-Mobile-Application
The App, collects the detailed information of the symptoms that the patient has been experiencing and then directs him/her to follow a set of instructions (for both COVID and black fungus). In case of severity a message will be sent to the hospital and an emergency call can be made to the hospital to book a bed by using our app.


This is our project, you can access the code and the details of the project using the below link:
